# Tim Berners-Lee

Hello, my name is Yannick and I'm learning the webdevelopment with becode.
For my formation I needed to make a site about Tim Berners-Lee from this screenshot.

To put the li in column and inline them right after was a problem for me, but now I understand better the display: grid. (the contact link and images are in an ul)
